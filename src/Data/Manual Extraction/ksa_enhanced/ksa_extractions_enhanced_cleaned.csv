Leads and applies social science principles across four functional competencies: analysis, planning, integration, and assessments throughout the full range of military operations to influence perceptions and behavior, and to drive action or inaction of relevant actors. IO professionals coordinate, integrate, and synchronize information capabilities with military operations to achieve an information advantage over adversaries. 14F personnel leverage information and the integrated joint planning environment to achieve commander's objectives in an increasingly pervasive, dynamic, and interconnected information environment (IE). Additionally, IO officers possess core disciplines in Deception Activities, Military Information Support Operations (MISO), and Operations Security (OPSEC). Finally, IO officers perform IO management/staff functions to include acquisition, career broadening, doctrine production, education and training, financial management, human capital/force management, information technology, modeling and simulation, policy, research and technology, security, and strategy. 2. Duties and Responsibilities: 2.1. Uses access to the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System, Tier 5 (T5) information systems or similar classified/privileged information environments to provide insight into adversary intentions, weaknesses, and potential vulnerabilities in a timely manner that allows expedient operational design and faster completion of friendly observe, orient, decide, act (OODA) cycles. Characterizes, forecasts, anticipates, and seizes the initiative in the IE to support the joint force commander’s decision superiority and integrates IE outcomes with Operation Environment. Equips policy makers, planners, and targeteers with the tools to maintain or influence perceptions and attitudes that drive behavior and decision-making of key leaders, groups, and organizations, enhancing air power effects through the IE and increases permissibility of all operations, activities, and investments (OAI) across the spectrum of conflict and peacetime engagements. 2.2. Manages planning for flexible and adaptive operations through the joint planning process in support of higher headquarters’ and commander’s objectives and desired effects. Identifies IO scope, planning support requirements, relevant aspects, and centers of gravity of the physical, informational, and cognitive dimensions of the IE. Recognizes desired and undesired effects that support or degrade Joint Force Commander’s information objectives and recommends effects and activities that support tasks in the IE, while calculating 2nd and 3rd order effects. Ensures consistency and credibility of actions, words, and deeds through comprehensive coordination. Understands the fundamental concepts, principles, and doctrine required to develop the air portion of a joint/combined campaign plan and ensure IO supports the strategic end states. 2.3. Directs the synchronized planning, execution, and assessment of kinetic and non-kinetic capabilities into the targeting cycle to effectively wage information warfare throughout the full spectrum of military operations. Provides considerations for targets that are vulnerable and susceptible to operations in the IE, capabilities that can be applied to achieve the desired effects of those operations, and how to assess the results once those capabilities have been applied. Leads and develops kinetic and non-kinetic capability requirements as part of the effects-based approach to targeting for both preplanned and dynamic situations. Serves as the primary subject matter expert throughout the target nomination and review process for human targets that, if engaged, will create a desired effect within the operational environment. 2.4. Drives the coordination and integration of information capabilities with Service, Joint, and Interagency organizations. Advises leadership regarding implications, execution, analysis, theories and research findings relevant to the disciplines of Deception Activities, MISO, and OPSEC.
