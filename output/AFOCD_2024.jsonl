Description of CIP Education Matrix:\n1.1. The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) provides a taxonomic scheme providing accurate tracking and reporting of\nfields of study and program completions activity. CIP was originally developed by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for\nEducation Statistics (NCES) in 1980, with revisions occurring in 1985, 1990, and 2000. For more information on CIP codes and\ndescriptions, visit http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/Default.aspx?y=55. By using CIP codes, each AFS can define, specifically, entry\neducation requirements for the career field. CIP codes and associated descriptions are based on a tiered structure. An officer’s education\nmust be mapped to a CIP code and then used for accession into an AFS.\n1.2. CIP Education Matrix Rule set.\n1.2.1. For entry into the AFS, it is mandatory that an officer accession meet at least one of the tiers listed in the CIP matrix for the AFS in\nwhich they are to be accessed. Each AFS has a different set of requirements and tier structure. If an officer doesn’t meet any of the tier\nrequirements in the matrix, they are not qualified to enter the AFS. Each tier in the matrix contains definitions for the following: target\naccession rates, CIP codes and associated descriptions of the CIP codes, and requirement type for entry in the AFS tier.\n1.2.2. Target Accession Rates are defined in each AFS’s CIP Education Matrix. Tier 1 target accession rates are generally the largest\nbecause the desired population for each AFS should be a Tier 1 officer. Tier 2 and tier 3 target accession rates follow suit. There are some\nAFSs which have only one tier due to the strict educational entry requirements. 61CXN and 61DXN have only one tier defined with target\naccession rates for these AFSCs being 100%. When distributing officer accessions across the education needs of all AFSs, tier 1\nrequirements are considered first until the pool of available accessions with matching education has been exhausted. Tier 2 accessions will\nthen be considered, then tier 3, and so on. When the remaining accessions do not match tier requirements for a specific AFS, the career\nfield will stop accessing new officers for the year and the remaining accessions will enter other AFSs with more compatible education\nrequirements.\n276"}

Special Experience Identifiers (SEI). SEIs complement other classification tools to provide the means to record and retrieve specific\nexperience and training to satisfy management needs. Requests to establish, delete, or revise SEIs are according to the Air Force Career\nField Managers’ Guide available in myFSS (NOTE: To access the embedded link: right-click, select “copy link location,” paste the link\nin an Internet Browser, and select Air Force Career Field Managers’ Guide located on the Active Duty: Military Classifications Page in\nmyFSS; or navigate direct from the myFSS Home Page. To search the myFSS knowledge base, type Career Field Managers’ Guide into\nthe Search Knowledge Article Box, then select Career Field Managers’ Guide from the drop-down menu listing).\nNOTE: *save files to the desktop/folder to view attachments*\n2. The Alphanumeric Structure. The officer SEI is a three-character alphanumeric code, consisting of an activity code (first character)\nand an experience set (last two characters). The activity code identifies possible activities performed in a variety of utilization fields.\nSection III-A lists activity codes and definitions. An experience set identifies a particular system, level of experience, or the type of\nexperience. Section III-B contains authorized experience sets. Activity codes may be used with any experience set to form a SEI.\n3. Use of SEIs. SEIs provide a method to quickly screen the officer database for specific experience, and SEIs may be used in the officer\nassignment process. Interaction of activity codes with experience sets and the broad application guidelines relating to AFSC- SEI\nrelationship (no AFSC constraints) provide assignment officers the capability for finite identification of experience, training, and\nqualifications to use in meeting management needs.\n4. Functional Users and Manpower Responsibilities. Over 46,000 separate SEI codes are possible in the officer SEI program when\ncombining the Activity Code and Experience Set. The size of such a system, coupled with no MilPDS edits on officer SEIs to any\nparticular AFSC, limits ability of any single agency to control placement of SEIs on unit manpower documents. Functional users are the\nmost important link in the success of the officer SEI program and benefit most by the SEI program. Functional users must frequently\nreview each position under their areas of responsibility to determine appropriateness of identifying positions by SEI.
