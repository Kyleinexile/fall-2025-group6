The occupational structure is flexible\nto permit enlisted personnel to specialize and develop their skills and abilities while allowing the Department of the Air Force to meet\nchanging mission requirements. Individual enlisted personnel have a joint responsibility with commanders and supervisors at all levels to\nfully develop their abilities consistent with the Department of Air Force needs and within the established patterns of specialization. This\ndirectory is written primarily for use by personnel officials (officers and senior noncommissioned officers) and agencies engaged in\nprocurement, classification, and training of Air Force members. It implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-21, Utilization and\nClassification of Air Force Military Personnel. Refer to AFMAN 36-2100, Military Utilization and Classification, for military\nclassification tenets and base level procedures. Maintain and dispose of records created as a result of prescribed processes in accordance\nwith the Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) accessed from the web-Records Information Management System (Note: To access the\nembedded link: right-click, select “copy link location,” and paste the link in an Internet Browser). RELEASABILITY: There are no\nreleasability restrictions on this publication.\nSUMMARY OF REVISIONS\nThis is the official directory for all military enlisted classification descriptions, codes, and identifiers. Updates to this directory are\naccording to the Air Force Career Field Managers’ Guide available at the myFSS Web Site. (Note: To access the embedded link: right-\nclick, select “copy link location,” paste the link in an Internet Browser, and select the Air Force Career Field Manager’s Guide located on\nthe Active Duty: Military Classifications Page in myFSS; or navigate direct from the myFSS Home Page.

This update contains all\nchanges that have been approved and scheduled for implementation on 30 April 2024 and provides a Change Summary and Conversion\nInstruction Guide (CS&CIG) or Change Summary Guides (CSG), as necessary. Each CS&CIG will include a summary of each change,\nconversion instructions for all AFSC changes, mergers, additions, realignments, and deletions of classification identifiers, and appropriate\npage changes to the directory. Subsequent Change Summary Guides along with the description changes will be identified by the effective\ndate and as an appendix to the CS&CIG for that particular conversion cycle.\nAdditionally, minor changes and corrections throughout the publication include correcting spelling or editing errors.\nNOTE: When a  precedes the specialty description or title, it denotes a major or significant revision from the previous edition –\nthe reader must read the particular section of the publication in its entirety to determine the extent of the changed material.\nNOTE: AFPC/DP3DW would like to clarify that it is not responsible for any system or policy changes related to the incorporation\nof “Space Force Specialty Codes” (SFSCs) or the title of “Guardian” within the Department of the Air Force Enlisted\nClassification Directory. The amendments made in this document are limited to title adjustments for the purpose of appropriately\nrepresenting our newest service branch, the United States Space Force, and its members, known as Guardians. These changes do\nnot signify or imply any policy or systemic alterations within the Department of the Air Force or the United States Space Force.\nUsing This Directory:\nThis directory contains a Change Summary and Conversion Instruction Guide (CS&CIG) for each update to the classification system, a\nQuick-Reference Guide, the Enlisted Classification Structure Chart to depict career progression through the specialties, Authorized\nPrefixes, Reporting Identifiers, Special Duty Identifiers, Air Force Specialty (AFS) descriptions, their assigned Air Force Specialty Codes\n(AFSCs) and/or Space Force Specialty Codes (SFSCs), Additional Mandatory Requirements for AFSC/SFSC Entry, Special Experience\nIdentifiers, and Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) codes used in the enlisted classification system. Use the specialty descriptions and codes\nto identify different types of Department of the Air Force jobs and the qualifications of enlisted personnel to fill these jobs. Individual\nspecialty descriptions and other attachments to this manual provide the occupational standards required or desired for successful\nperformance in an AFS. Use these standards to procure, classify, and employ enlisted personnel; to develop career programs for initial\ntraining, retraining, and skill upgrade; and to structure unit manpower document (UMD) positions.\nAttachment 4, Additional Mandatory Requirements for AFSC/SFSC Entry, contains a consolidated listing by AFSC/SFSC of\nmandatory requirements and restrictions for AFSC/SFSC entry or reTraining. This listing includes AFSCs/SFSCs not open to non-United\nStates citizens, AFSCs/SFSCs authorized for use without shredouts, minimum physical profiles, and strength and mental aptitude scores\nfor AFSC/SFSC entry or reTraining.\nAFMAN 36-2100, Military Utilization and Classification, contains the procedural guidance for awarding and withdrawing classification\ncodes, and tables that show the grade spread to skill-level relationship used in authorizing UMD positions. For procedural system\nguidance, refer to the Active-Duty Personnel Services Delivery (PSD) Guide – Personnel Employment (Classification), the Active-Duty\nPersonnel Services Delivery (PSD) Guide – Special Experience Identifier (SEI) Process, and the Personnel Services Delivery (PSD)\nGuide – Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) Conversion, for personnel; and AFI 38-101, Manpower and Organization, for manpower.\n2"}

Special Experience Identifiers (SEI). The SEIs in this attachment identify special experience and training not otherwise identified\nwithin the military personnel data system (MilPDS). SEIs complement the assignment process but are not substitutes for AFSCs/SFSCs,\nCEM codes, prefixes, suffixes, SDIs, RIs, personnel processing codes, and professional specialty course codes. They are established when\nidentifying experience or training is critical to the job and person assignment match, and no other identification is appropriate or available.\nSEIs permit rapid identification of a resource already experienced to meet unique circumstances, contingency requirements, or\nmanagement needs. They provide a means to track individuals and identify positions requiring or providing unique experience or training\nthat otherwise would be lost. SEIs may be used to better distribute personnel and optimize the job and person match insofar as possible.\n2. Authorized AFSCs/SFSCs. Normally, AFSCs/SFSCs and CEM codes listed as authorized for use with SEIs refer to the basic\nAFSC/SFSC plus all shredouts. All authorized skill levels of the basic AFSC/SFSC are listed, including 9-skill levels and CEMs. If an\nAFSC/SFSC is listed with the first 5 digits and an “X” in the 6th position, i.e.: 3P051X, then the SEI is authorized for use with the basic\nAFSC/SFSC and all suffixes authorized with that AFSC/SFSC. If an “X” is used in the skill level position it means that all skill levels are\nauthorized for use with the SEI.\n3. SEI Structure. The SEI code is composed of three numeric characters or three alphanumeric characters. Individual characters within\nthe codes have no specific meaning. Most SEIs are authorized for award with specific AFSCs/SFSCs; some are authorized with any\nAFSC/SFSC.\n4. Establishing SEIs. Requests to establish, delete, or revise SEIs must be submitted according to the instructions provided in the Air\nForce Career Field Manager’s Guide available at the myFSS Web Site. (Note: To access the embedded link: right-click, select “copy link\nlocation,” paste the link in an Internet Browser, and select the Air Force Career Field Manager’s Guide located on the Active Duty:\nMilitary Classifications Page in myFSS; or navigate direct from the myFSS Home Page. To search the myFSS knowledge base, type in\nCareer Field Manager’s Guide into the Search Knowledge Article Box, then select Career Field Manager’s Guide from the drop-\ndown menu listing. *Save a copy of the file to the desktop/folder to view attachments*\n5. SEI Fields in the MilPDS. SEIs that may be concurrently recorded in an airman record are currently set to five with the primary\nAFSC, five with the 2AFSC, four with the 3AFSC, three with the 4AFSC, and one in the general SEI area. Computer edits ensure the\nAFSC-SEI combinations are valid. The general area is used for SEIs authorized with any AFSC. A general SEI is used as a marker in the\nPersonnel system to show a specific type of training or experience available to any Airman/Guardians. This experience is not limited by\nAFSC/SFSC. CAFSC SEI is not used by base level to award a SEI to the member. CAFSC SEI reflects an SEI code attached to the\nposition the member is assigned and will reflect as the CAFSC SEI as a suspense indicator. If the member is not expected to gain the\nexperience required to be awarded the SEI designated to the position, they should be removed from that position.\n6. MilPDS-Generated SEI Award Notification (Personnel Services Delivery Guide - Special Experience Identifier (SEI) Process.) The\nCAFSC is designated with the SEI when an enlisted airman is assigned to a unit manpower document (UMD) position identified with the\nSEI. For SEIs designated as auto-notify, once experience and training requirements have been satisfied a MilPDS suspense notification\nwill be provided as a reminder to award the SEI. Award suspense is performed for numeric SEIs only. For SEIs designated as auto-award,\nonce experience and training requirements have been satisfied, MilPDS will award the SEI to the member. It will do so unless the member\nis removed from the SEI-coded position or the commander directs a change to the award suspense date prior to meeting the experience\nrequirement.\nClick:\nTo view the 31 Oct 24\nTable of Enlisted SEIs\n404"}

Description and General Duties. CEM codes contained in this attachment identify all chief master sergeant positions in the Enlisted\nClassification Structure. They also identify chief master sergeants that, through extensive experience and training, have demonstrated\nmanagerial ability to plan, direct, coordinate, implement, and control a wide range of work activity. Some managerial duties and\nresponsibilities that are common to all chief enlisted managers are:\n1.1. Manages and directs personnel resource activities; interprets and enforces policy and applicable directives.\n1.2. Establishes control procedures to meet work goals and standards.\n1.3. Recommends or initiates actions to improve functional operation efficiency.\n1.4. Plans and programs work commitments and schedules.\n1.5. Develops plans regarding facilities, supplies, and equipment procurement and maintenance.\n2. CEM Composition and Concept. CEM codes in many cases are made up of a series of existing superintendent specialties where the\ndegree of supervisory and managerial task involvement permits expanded resource use. As chief enlisted managers, chief master sergeants\nwill be subject to working in a variety of similar jobs and functional areas where their general managerial and supervisory abilities can be\nmost effectively used and challenged.\n3. Award Criteria. CEM codes are awarded according to procedures outlined in AFMAN 36-2100. Basic requirements for awarding\nCEM codes are:\n3.1. Be in the grade of chief master sergeant (or chief master sergeant selectee).\n3.2. Possess qualification in a feeder specialty. The expanded duties and responsibilities, qualifications, and other specialty data for\nCEM codes are drawn from 9 level “feeder” specialty descriptions, consistent with the function and job performed.

Prior service applicants, eligible for enlistment in the Air Force and possessing a convertible\nskill listed on the attached conversion list, may be awarded the 3-skill level AFSC provided the applicant meets the below eligibility\ncriteria. Documentation of formal training completion is required.\n2. Being listed as a convertible skill waives only the completion of the mandatory initial skills course(s); the 3-skill level awarding\ncourse listed in the appropriate specialty description attachment of the AF Enlisted Classification Directory (DAFECD). All other\nmandatory entry requirements listed in the DAFECD, including attachment 4 (except for ASVAB requirements), and upgrade\nrequirements for the applicable AFSC apply.\n3. Apply the guidance outlined in AFMAN 36-2100, Military Utilization and Classification, Downgrade and Withdrawal of AFSC, to all\nbranches of the service, including the Air Force, when determining individual’s qualifications. If the individual’s specialty should have\nbeen withdrawn as a result of non-duty performance in the specialty as outlined in AFMAN 36-2100, then follow the guidance further\noutlined in paragraph 4.1.2.3.4, to determine if the individual is qualified for enlistment using the convertible skills provision.\n4. Individuals having a convertible skill listed for the AFSC requested and otherwise qualified for enlistment may be awarded the 3- skill\nlevel in the selected AFSC.\n5.
